#### By **Eric Wafula, Rebecca Nzau, Sultan Mwangovya, Shaquille Sande, Enoch Abere**
## Description
Over time within Moringa, most students will notice that they are usually facing the same technical problems. This can sometimes become hectic in getting an answer and can sometimes lead to duplication in the help that they get in that they can ask for help on an area that has already been covered.

The same situation presents itself when within programming environments.

This app helps tackle these challenges by providing a simple solutions for students to get their most pressing questions answered through the pool of other students and/or Technical Mentors/Support
